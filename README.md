# archdotfiles
Just dotfiles for arch

## "hard" to install
camelcase motion is kind of weird because it is distributed as a vimball from
the vim website and you have to open it with neovim or vim and it will be able
to deploy it self into the folders it needs to go, plugged/docs etc.
but it is really nice, so should install it again with a new distribution


## tips

remember to add the .pgpass file and .vimrcpg
